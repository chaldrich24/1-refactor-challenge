# Code Refactor Horiseon - Challenge #1

These files update the HTML and CSS for the Horiseon home page which previously had redundant code and a lack of adherence to accessibility standards. By fixing
these downfalls in the old code, the website is now better optimized for search engine visibility.

## Updates
- Older HTML elements have been updated to their respective semantic elements
- Broken links have been corrected
- Long, redundant blocks of CSS have been repurposed for better readability
- CSS comments added
- Alternative text has been created for important images
- HTML unnecessary classes removed
